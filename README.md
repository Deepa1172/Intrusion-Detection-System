# Intrusion Detection System using NSL-KDD Dataset üõ°Ô∏èüîç

## Overview

This project focuses on building an Intrusion Detection System using the NSL-KDD dataset, which offers advantages over the original KDD dataset by eliminating redundancy and bias, allowing for more accurate evaluation of machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Description

The NSL-KDD dataset is a refined version of the original KDD dataset:
- **No redundant records** in the training set to avoid bias towards frequent records.
- **No duplicate records** in the proposed test sets to prevent biased performance evaluation.
- **Selected records** from each difficulty level group maintain proportionality with the original KDD dataset, enabling more diverse classification rates for different machine learning methods.
- Reasonable size of records in both train and test sets, facilitating consistent and comparable evaluation results for different research works.

## Model and Performance

- Utilized **PCA** to select **10 features** out of 114, reducing dimensionality while retaining significant information.
- Employed the **Decision Tree** model achieving an accuracy of **97.67% on test data** and **100% on training data**.
- All code and implementation details are present in the `ipynb` notebook within the repository.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.comDeepa1172/Intrusion-Detection-System.git
   ```

2. Open the `ipynb` notebook to explore the code and methodology used for the intrusion detection system.

## Next Steps

- Experiment with other models or fine-tune existing models for further improving performance.
- Consider deploying the model for real-time intrusion detection.
